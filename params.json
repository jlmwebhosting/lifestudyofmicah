The Prophet's Observation of Discouragement\r\nFirst, the prophet observed the condition and situation of God's chosen people and became fully discouraged (vv. 1-6). In his discouragement he said, \"Woe is me! For I am like a gathering of summer fruit/And like a gleaning of the vintage;/There is no cluster to eat,/Nor first-ripe fig, which my soul desires./The godly man has perished from the land, /And there is none upright among men;/They all lie in wait for bloodshed;/They each hunt their brother with a net\" (vv. 1-2).\r\nIn Micah's observation of discouragement there is a lesson for us today. From Micah's experience we should learn not to look at ourselves. If we look at ourselves just a little, we will be discouraged.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
